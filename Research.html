						<h1> About Christ Central</h1>
					</header>
					<p1 class="inner"> The teachings, example, and challenge of Jesus Christ, our faith in Him, and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit are the motivation for and foundation of our efforts, and our mission, in its simplest terms, is to honor Jesus by serving others faithfully and wisely while watching and giving thanks for all that God is doing. It is our hope that, in that process, others will hear and respond to the Good News of Jesus.
						Christ Central Ministries believes that communities are rich in unrecognized resources, undiagnosed problems, and, with respect to poverty solutions, leadership vacuums. Christ Central’s mission is to enrich those communities through a process of disciplined research, careful diagnoses, and loving remedies. We accomplish that by energizing the churches, schools, businesses, individuals, and government to work together to develop effective leaders, multiply resources, and focus those resources on the most serious problems.</p1>

						Poverty in South Carolina.
					</h3>
					<p> The poverty rate in South Carolina is 16.6%. One out of every 6 residents of South Carolina lives in poverty.
					</p>
					<p> 790,657 of 4,751,345 residents reported income levels below the poverty line in the last year.
					</p>
					<p> 25.1% of the population for whom poverty status is determined in Williamsburg County, SC, which is the poorist county in South Carolina.</p>
					<h1>
						Poverty in the United States
					</h1>
					<p> 
						Poverty does not strike all demographics equally. For example, in 2018, 10.6% of men, and 12.9% of women lived in Poverty in the USA. 
						Along the same lines, the poverty rate for married couples in 2018 was only 4.7% - but the poverty rate for single-parent families with no wife present was 12.7%, and for single-parent families with no husband present was 24.9%.
						In 2018, the poverty rate for people living with a disability was 25.7%. That’s nearly 4 million people living with a disability—in poverty.
						The USDA estimated that 11.1% of US households were food insecure in 2018.  This means that approximately 14.3 million households had difficulty providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources. 
						Rates of food insecurity were substantially higher than the national average for households with incomes near or below the Federal poverty line.
						</p>
					<p>
						From Social Security to food stamps to the earned-income tax credit and on and on, we have enacted programs that now keep 40 million people out of poverty. Poverty would be nearly double what it is now without these measures, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
						With all of that, why have we not achieved more? Four reasons: An astonishing number of people work at low-wage jobs. Plus, many more households are headed now by a single parent, making it difficult for them to earn a living income from the jobs that are typically available. The near disappearance of cash assistance for low-income mothers and children — i.e., welfare — in much of the country plays a contributing role, too. And persistent issues of race and gender mean higher poverty among minorities and families headed by single mothers.
						According to the most recent data available from the Census Bureau, 104 million people — a third of the population — have annual incomes below twice the poverty line, less than $38,000 for a family of three. They struggle to make ends meet every month.
