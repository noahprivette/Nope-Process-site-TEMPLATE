						Mr. Mark
						
					</h2>
					<p class="small">
						Works for my church. He has volunteered at the food pantry part of Christ Central. I had forgotten about how covid has affected the christ central food pantry. He brought up good points about them having to move to bagged lunch because of it. He said that if christ central had a grocery list of things they need on their website he would buy stuff to help out. He also said he thought a menu would be helpful for the homeless. He said that a section to get involved would help people be more proactive. For example, he didn’t know they took canned goods until covid.last time he went to the website, he couldn’t really find anything. He thought that in general that the place for donations was hard to find. He wondered who or if they are affiliated with a certain government service like social services. In this interview, I gained a lot of knowledge of how covid has affected christ central. I'll definitely try to incorporate some of the things he said like the menu and making the donations more apparent.

						Mrs. Carole
						
					</h2>
					<p class="small">
						Works closely with Christ Central, she is pretty much how my church gets information from Christ Central. She has served at the food pantry called Columbia Missions Station. She remembered the old website before the current one and said that one reminded her of a church newsletter. She said it was hard for her to find the services on the current page. She says christ central has plenty of events and she wishes the website would advertise about it more. For example they have had a garage sale. She thought a schedule would be nice because they are particular about time. She thought the website needed more details. She brought up the fact that the homeless could go to the library to use the internet. She also said that she works at the Columbia Missions Station but on the website it is called something completely different. She thought the website needed a spot for if you need help or if you wanted to help out. Overall she thought the website needed a little more tweaking for functionality. My main takeaways for this interview is that the website just needs more functions that will help people get the services they need.
